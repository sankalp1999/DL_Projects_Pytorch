It was Dec, 2019 when I had finally mustered up some courage to start learning Deep Learning. Since, then I have done stuff(not so consistently).
Deep Learning and Machine Learning have the capability to increase your interest in mathematics and programming in general.(Programming 2.0)
You can see all the mathematics you have learnt till 2nd year or 1st year of Engineering being applied. Literally, almost all of the math behind the scenes.

Frameworks like Pytorch, libraries like Keras and Fast.ai can make significantly easier. (I don't know about TensorFlow xD). 

This repository contains codes for the assignments and some projects which I had done in the course **[Intro to Deep Learning using Pytorch](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188)** (as a part of the Udacity Bertelsmann Scholarship Challenge)

The course can be taken for free (Not sure about assignents while auditing because I was not auditing.)

The course is good. It's less on the theoeritical side but enough to get an understanding. It's more on the practical side. I would say
it's something between Fast.ai and Deeplearning.ai.

You could see some results below.
