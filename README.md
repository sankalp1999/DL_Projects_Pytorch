This repository contains codes for the assignments and some projects which I had done in the course **[Intro to Deep Learning using Pytorch](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188)** (as a part of the Udacity Bertelsmann Scholarship Challenge)

The course can be taken for free (Not sure about assignents while auditing because I was not auditing.)

The course is good. It's less on the theoeritical side but enough to get an understanding. It's more on the practical side. I would say
it's something between Fast.ai and Deeplearning.ai.

You could see some results below.
